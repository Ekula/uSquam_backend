# Meeting notes, April 4

## To be added functionality
* Priority: let the worker select a task (or type of task), let the worker skip the task (go back to the navigation menu)
* Priority: Quality control, review tasks should redirect a completed task to another worker to let him approve or disapprove a result (optimally with the option to edit an answer).
Situational tasks cannot be reviewed since this would take the situationality aspect away. 
* Improve the conversational skills of the chatbot
* Add reward credits, think of monetary conversion
* Add possibility to download results from requesters front-end
