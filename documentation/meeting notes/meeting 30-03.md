# Meeting notes, March 30

## Platform requirements
* Use Elastic search for filtering data, e.g. filtering tweets on their specific hashtag or tweets made in the morning. 
* Situational task: go to a specific location and describe the ambience there. The locality aspect is missing in ‘make a selfie looking angry’.
* You only need to implement one type of quality control, e.g. review task -> let another worker review the answer given to a task
* Don’t worry about knowing how to cheat your own chatbot
* Come up with a story how this chatbot can be used: create a mobile application where you can automatically recognize the expression on the picture, e.g. apply filtering in picture on Instagram based on shown mood. Based on your facial expression recommend a bar to go to.  The story should be business related. 

## Project status
1. Individual components (session handler, idle handler, chatbot) need to be linked
2. Pipelines need to be created with three specific use cases
3. Send first prototype to Pavel on Friday, March 31st
