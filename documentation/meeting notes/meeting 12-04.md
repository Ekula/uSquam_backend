# Meeting notes, April 12

## Three use cases 
Expand the three use cases to relate them more to  the restaurant owner story.
	These are our ideas for the demo:
	1. Describe the cuisine and average price of menus (global data source) + review tasks.
	2. Make a picture of a restaurant's interior, describe the ambience/ number of people (situational)
	3. Show beer advertisements and let the worker evaluate them (local data source, optional).

## Presentation (last-minute preparations)
* Work on the story behind your presentation: marketing research. Nowadays it is expensive and incorrect (based on outdated web data and guesses). 
	1. Small-scaled: competitor analysis (prices, products)
	2. Large-scaled: overall market analysis (interest, locations)

Benefits:
* uSquam is cheaper
* It offers better ways to explore overall market opportunities
* Competitor analysis (situational data)

* Improve the readability of the chatbot UI:
	1. Add an avatar to the chatbot
	2. Emphasize textual task collection data
	3. Emphasize instructions about tasks

## Product evaluation
Survey questions should be targeted at the usability of the application and the reward of the worker (minimal amount of credits)
